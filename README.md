# infrastructure-demo

## Intro
Ever wondered how **high availability (HA)** looks like in practice? Wanted to get your hands dirty, but examples on internet look complicated and difficult for you to start? This "package" provides you with simple setup to make HA environment ready for you on your own cluster of 3 VMs and application (with CLI) on this cluster that does all the dirty work for you, so you can just start experimenting with high availability right away and see for yourself.

## Overview
- Simple application demonstrating how using containerization can lead to better scalability and robustness of app
- HA environment cluster consisting of 3 VMs
- Divided on two parts:
  1. Setup of HA environment in this cluster
  2. Running infrastructure demo app in such environment for demonstration
  
- Consists of 4 services (web, database, logger, visualizator) and CLI app for easy orchestration
- Technologies used:
  - Containerization - Docker
  - Orchestration - Docker Swarm
  - HA distributed storage - GlusterFS
  - Programming language - Python
  - Webserver - Python Flask  

## Setup
To be able to use application, we first need to setup environment for it. In this section we will provide instructions on how to correctly setup cluster of 3 VMs to properly run our infrastructure demo in it. You **MUST FOLLOW** these instructions **EXACTLY** as they are. It's tested and it will provide you with needed environment. Should you run commands or follow instructions in different order as they are written here, there is no warranty it will create needed environment for you! 

1. Download [Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS 64-bit](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
2. Install it on 3 VMs -> minimal install -> for machine names (hostnames) I used *ubuntu1-vm*, *ubuntu2-vm*, *ubuntu3-vm* but you can use anything you'd like -> everything accept and continue (I used VMware Workstation 15 software for virtual machines, but I suppose any other VM software should be good as well)
3. `python3` should be installed by default (3.10.4), but should it from any reason not be, then install it.
4. Copy `demo-init` folder (or all scripts from it) to all VMs - it contains all necessary installation and initialization scripts
5. Run `bash docker-install.sh` on all machines. This will install docker (and it's dependencies) and adds user into docker group so we won't be needing to run docker always with `sudo`.
6. reboot (to make this permission with `sudo` and docker group work)
7. Follow `add-hosts.txt` file to add hosts into VMs
8. On **JUST ONE of VMs** we will initialize docker swarm by running `docker swarm init --advertise-addr MASTER_IP`, where MASTER_IP is IP of given VM where are we running docker swarm init (IP of this VM from these 3 IPs which we gave into `/etc/hosts`). Let's call this machine MASTER.
9. Ignore the output of this command on master machine. Subsequently, run on it command `docker swarm join-token manager`. It will return something like `docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-09c0p3304ookcnibhg3lp5ovkjnylmxwjac9j5puvsj2wjzhn1-2vw4t2474ww1mbq4xzqpg0cru 192.168.1.67:2377`
10. Run this command on other 2 VMs and they should connect to swarm as managers.

Right now, we should be in state, such that all 3 machines are connected to swarm as managers. We can check it by running `docker node ls` and should see all machines, from which one is leader and other 2 are reachable. If this is correct, then you are in desired state.
Just for info, we are connecting all machines to swarm as managers because of HA of nodes, so that if we simulate death of ONE node (any of them), whole infrastructure will be further working.

This setup was created mostly by compilation of these three websites ([1](https://thenewstack.io/tutorial-create-a-docker-swarm-with-persistent-storage-using-glusterfs/), [2](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), [3](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/))
